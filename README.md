# REACT CALCULATOR APP
Built a calculator for Math-magicians Inc using create-react-app.
Math-magicians is a fictional company based in France. They have requested help to build a simple product that would assist them with their calculations. An important thing to notice is that they have asked for a product that is just fully-functional more than it needs to be beautiful these for minimal css is used. The project is focused on practicing state and props available to a react component class, it is not using hooks.
